## About WebOS

WebOS is an ambitious, single-file web application that brilliantly simulates a full-fledged Linux-like desktop environment directly in your web browser. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it offers a surprisingly rich and interactive user experience, complete with a boot sequence, a login screen, and a wide array of functional, albeit simulated, applications.

Dive into a retro-futuristic desktop experience, explore a virtual file system, execute a vast set of Linux-like commands in the terminal, play classic games, and customize your workspace ‚Äì all without leaving your browser tab!

## Features

WebOS is packed with a multitude of features designed to mimic a real operating system:

## Getting Started

To get WebOS up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Save the Code:** Copy the entire HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code block provided and save it into a file named `index.html`.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file using any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3.  **Boot Sequence:** Wait for the simulated boot sequence to complete.
4.  **Login:** Enter the default credentials:
    *   **Username:** `user`
    *   **Password:** `password`
    And click "Sign In".

You will then be greeted by the WebOS desktop!

## Usage

### Boot & Login

Upon opening `index.html`, you'll first see a boot screen. This simulates an OS startup. After a few seconds, the login screen will appear. Use `user` for the username and `password` for the password to access the desktop. Your login choice will affect the user context in the terminal and file system.

### Desktop Interaction

*   **Icons:** Double-click any desktop icon to launch its corresponding application.
*   **Windows:**
    *   Drag windows by their title bar.
    *   Click the `_` button to minimize, `[]` to maximize/restore, and `X` to close.
    *   Click on a window to bring it to the foreground (focus).
*   **Taskbar:** Click on an application icon in the taskbar to focus or restore a minimized window.
*   **Start Menu:** Click the "üêß Start" button to open the start menu and browse all applications.
*   **Context Menu:** Right-click on the desktop background to open a context menu with quick actions.
*   **Notifications:** Keep an eye on the top-right corner for system notifications.

### Terminal Commands

The WebOS Terminal is a core feature.
*   **Launch:** Open the Terminal from the desktop icon or start menu.
*   **Basic Interaction:** Type commands and press `Enter`.
*   **Help:** Type `help` to see a list of all available commands.
*   **System Info:** Try `neofetch` for a visually appealing system overview.
*   **File System:** Use `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv` to navigate and manage your virtual files.
*   **Sudo:** Type `sudo` to enter a simulated superuser mode. Type `exit` to leave `sudo` mode.
*   **History:** Use the `Arrow Up` and `Arrow Down` keys to navigate through your command history.
*   **Autocomplete:** Press `Tab` to auto-complete commands.

### File System Persistence

All files and directories you create or modify within the WebOS environment (via the Terminal or File Explorer) are saved in your browser's `localStorage`. This means your virtual file system will persist even if you close and reopen the `index.html` page. The same applies to your chosen theme, wallpaper, and game high scores.

## Technical Details

*   **Single File:** The entire application is contained within a single `index.html` file, making it incredibly easy to deploy and share.
*   **Vanilla Stack:** Built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating powerful web capabilities without frameworks.
*   **Client-Side Persistence:** Utilizes `localStorage` for all data persistence, ensuring a stateless server-side is not required.
*   **Simulated Environment:** All OS functionalities, applications, and system resources are simulated client-side. There is no actual backend or real operating system running.

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

This project has immense potential for expansion. Here are some ideas for future development:

*   **Advanced File System:** Implement drag-and-drop for files/folders, more robust permissions, and a Recycle Bin that actually holds deleted items.
*   **Multi-user Support:** Expand the login system to support multiple user profiles with independent file systems.
*   **True Web Integration:** Utilize iframes or proxies within the browser app for actual external web browsing.
*   **Real-time System Stats:** Integrate with browser APIs (if available and secure) to show actual (or more sophisticated simulated) system resource usage.
*   **Expand Applications:**
    *   More playable games.
    *   A functional drawing application.
    *   Simple text-based adventure games in the terminal.
    *   More advanced features for existing apps (e.g., calculator memory, music player playlists, calendar event management).
*   **Package Manager Simulation:** A more interactive `apt` or `dnf` simulation for installing "new" applications or tools.
*   **Customization:** Allow users to upload their own wallpapers or custom themes.
*   **Networking:** Simulate a local network with other "WebOS" instances or services.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Adapt the desktop environment for smaller screens and touch interactions.
